# Overview

Moovâ€™s mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

ACHGateway is an extensible, highly-available, distributed, and fault-tolerant Nacha ACH uploader and downloader. ACHGateway facilitates the uploading and downloading of ACH files, generating events for external services and modifying files to meet the practical demands of production environments. For an introduction to ACH [refer to our guide](https://moov-io.github.io/ach/intro/).

Payment systems need to be adaptable for all kinds of uses and this is the primary goal of ACHGateway. Typically businesses submit ACH files (in their Nacha format) to initiate debits/credits against bank accounts. An Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI) can be your legal and financial partner. ACHGateway can optimize and streamline the integration to your ODFI.
